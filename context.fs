//====================== Context ========================

/**
 * A context is a builtin that stores modeling data, including bodies (solid, sheet, wire, and point), their
 * constituent topological entities (faces, edges, and vertices), variables, feature error states, etc.
 * All features, operations, and evaluation functions require a context to operate on. Different contexts do not
 * interact, but data may be transferred from one to another using `opMergeContexts`.
 *
 * Each context keeps track of the version at which it was created. While regenerating a feature that has been
 * "held back" to an older version, the version reported by the context will be the older version, causing subfeatures
 * and operations to emulate old behavior.

//====================== Id ========================

/**
 * An Id identifies a feature in a context. Each feature, subfeature, and operation must have a unique id. Ids are
 * used in queries, error reporting, and accessing data associated with features. Ids are hierarchical: each subfeature
 * must have an id that is the id of its parent feature plus optionally its own subId. The root id is constructed by
 * `newId()` and subIds are added with the overloadeded addition operator: `id + "foo"` represents the id `id` with the
 * extra level "foo".
